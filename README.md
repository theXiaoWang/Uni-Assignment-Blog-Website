# Univeristy Assignment Blog Website
This is a blog website I build for university assignment with Pyhton Flask, HTML and Bootstrap. The database is mySQL of university server.
Deployed by OpenShift on University server, so can only access through university VPN. But here's the link anyway: http://flaskblog-flaskblog-last-2100322.apps.cs.cf.ac.uk/
